# Writing is Socially Exclusive

When a person writes, they do so by writing one letter at a time. Through a combination of letters they form the word-sound. Through a string of word-sounds they form a sentence-band. Through a sentence-band, a listener imagines the idea-substratum the sequencer wishes to communicate. 

Individually the letters are meaningless because they're dislocated from the idea-substratum. It's the idea-substratum that makes the sentence-band meaningful. Historically sentence-bands were confined to the scope of a breath. That is to say, the speaker speaks the sentence-band into existence by stopping.

When language transitioned from speech to drawing, however, the sentence-band had to be broken up into it's constituent bits. Each "inscription event" takes units of time for it's performance. To say "Hello. How are you?" might take under 2 seconds, but to write the letters it might take 8 seconds. Image reading recognition might take 1 second.

### Why does this matter?

Let's imagine there is a crowd of 30 people and I need to distribute my greeting and inquiry to each and every one of them. Through the speaking approach, this will take seconds. But what about the process of writing? And the process of reading? And the process of sharing? And the process of distributing? And the process of educating (to teach them how to read the words)? And the process of manufacturing (the paper and ink for the writing)? The time it takes to distribue the same message skyrockets, even creating an entire information economy through the concretization of sound.

# Examples:
[On the Future of Our Educational Institutions](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28146)
Nietzsche explains that education cannot be evenly distributed because people perpetually renounce man's interest in learning to perform state services.

[Plato's Allegory of the Cave](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/)
Plato explains through allegory that humans cannot leave "[[The Cave of Writing]]" without becoming socially weaker. Meaning the shadow-speculators are damned to speculate, not to gain higher knowledge, but to control peasants.

[A Note Upon the Mystic Writing Pad](https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/note-upon-mystic-writing-pad)
Derrida uses the thought experiment of the mystic writing pad to illustrate situational operational advantage. In one anthropological case I quote from memory, a shaman sees the power of operational exclusivity afforded by the pad and decides to copy it, strictly for it's influential utility. 

[Socrates Argues Politics is the Product of Operational Exclusion](https://classicalwisdom.com/greek_books/politics-by-aristotle-book-ii/)
In this case, "perfect unity" is when people are able to achieve a situation of operational overlap. Without it, however, writing's socially-exclusivity runs it's course and creates social division.
> But, even supposing that it were best for the community to have the greatest degree of unity, this unity is by no means proved to follow from the fact ‘of all men saying “mine” and “not mine” at the same instant of time,’ which, according to Socrates, is the sign of perfect unity in a state.

[The Communist Manifesto](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm)
Building off the ancient Platonic idea that "operational overlap" is the sign of perfect unity in a state, Marx & Engels attempt to persuade such a unity were possible. Just as the two sounds "mind" and "not mine" cancel each other out, combined operation is not possible, and annihilates the two opposing forces, killing them and transforming them into the "specter" haunting Europe. Only ghosts are capable of "operational overlap" and, therefore, the authors propose a project of death.

[Edmund Husserl's Complaints on Measurement](https://iep.utm.edu/phe-time/)
Husserl might say that we can say something exactly, but never exactly exactly. His paranoiac view is that mathematics is nothing but technique. It never narrows in on a "final" measurement or analysis of a thing because smaller units of measurement are always available. It becomes an infinite excuse by which to justify the avoidance of manual labor.
