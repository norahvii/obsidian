# The Axial Age
Karl Jaspers is perhaps best known for introducing the idea of the Axial Age: a pivotal age in human history when the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid. However, Jaspers only mentions the time frame: he doesn't describe the pivot of this turning point in history.

### How does the mechanism work?
[[Rhetorical Illusions]]
Using "rhetorical illusions" crowds of people were invited to mentally inject themselves into (worship) the minds of non-writer characters, most of whom professed a docterine that was designed to strip them of power. Usually these characters had a tragic backstory, or suffered a cruel fate.

[[From Anglers to Fishers]]
Sophistry was rebranded twice and became Christianity in the west. Buddhism in the east was sufficient for the suppression of crowds, however. But the funciton was the same and those who told the story had exclusive access to it as a method for hunting human beings.

[[Writing is socially exclusive]]
Because operational inclusion in the writing act is imposisble for a multitude, the increased practice of writing caused all writing mediums to multiply, even requiring [child labor](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/child-labor-in-the-united-states/) to maintain it.
