Leo Strauss is noteable for expousing an exoteric view of writing wherein he theorized the ancients wrote in such a way to [avoid persecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_and_the_Art_of_Writing). He was Jewish, making it less likely he expoused Nazism as some of his critics theorize. But first and foremost, Strauss asks us not to accept a text's meaning as dogma, but to investigate the world around the text to determine it's true meaning. Any given writer or thinker cannot be expected to have all their thinking formulated upon the foundation of [[Perfect Library]]. They are in essence interpreting and intuiting as they go along. Many important thinkers in the past have died by torture. Naturally, a practice of total information transparency wouldn't have serve them. Rather, as the word (exoteric) suggets, an "exoskelleton" of meaning serves to protect the underbelly of true intention, and it's up to the true readers to read between the lines.

Some critics have argued my philosophical interpretations are Straussian. This is because I reguard all philosophical and scientific knowledge as incomplete. If human beings knew the secrets of the universe, they would inhabit spaceships for interplanetary travel. They do not, however, so all knowledge presented is suspect, or at the very least incomplete. At the biological level, animals are systems working to defend themselves from a merciless universe. [[Writing is socially exclusive]] because, as an act, only one person can perform the act of inscription.
