We're going to start by explaining this:
$$
Sophistry \rightarrow Philosophy \rightarrow Christianity
$$
1. The evolution of sophistry to christianity didn't happen overnight, or even with one generation. Sophistry was described as an ancient practice of talking to people for a fee, without ever getting to the real nature of things. 
2. Sophistry became a pejorative primarily through Plato's use of the Socrates character. 
3. Functionally speaking, philosophy itself is indistinguishable from sophistry because both entail talking to people for a fee, and never understanding the real nature of things.
4. What philosophy does is describe the situational practice (of talking for a fee) as bad, through the use of Socrates as it's champion, then "rebrand" itself with the title "philosopher" as the "wise" recognizers and documenters of this evil, thereby allowing the practice (techné) of sophistry to "turn" against itself while still possessing all the same characteristics.
5. Plato describes sophistry, using [[Strauss]]ian Exoteric Defense, that a sophist is an "angler" of men, a fisher of men, and a hunter of human beings.
6. The Christians build upon this, because Jesus straightforwardly tells his disciples that I will make you "fishers" of men. 
7. Hiding their [human-fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys#:~:text=Early%20church,-According%20to%20tradition&text=According%20to%20one%20ancient%20story,they%20were%20in%20good%20company.) practice in plain sight, early Christian symbolism portrayed "tongues of fire" meant to symbolize "rhetorical ability."
8. To facilitate the human-hunting art, schools of rhetoric are established (which [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) attended), hence we come full full circle.
9. Gorgias was right, rhetoric is king, and it's rule was made more legitimate by sacrificing the "perfect" non-writer character. The epidemic use of this technique on the uneducated masses is what established [[The Axial Age]].

Chronologically-speaking, Jesus's use of the phrase "fishers" of men had to be a backwards reference to Plato's description of the sophist as an "angler." Because Socrates and Jesus didn't write, it lends further credence to the theory that both characters were merely rhetorical devices, or instruments of statecraft. 

Likewise, this "turn" is more than likely what Nietzsche imagined with his desire to "invert Platonism" as explained here:
>Nietzsche had defined the task of his philosophy, and indeed the philosophy of the future, as the reversal of Platonism. In an early sketch for his first treatise (1870–1871), he wrote: “My philosophy an inverted Platonism: the farther removed from true being, the purer, the finer, the better it is.

This is because, at an early point in his career, Nietzsche recognized that man's interest in learning was fake, in his early lecture "[On the Future of Our Educational Institutions](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28146)" where he remarks:

> It seemed to me that I must recognise two main directions in the forces at work . . . The first-named would, for various reasons, spread learning among the greatest number of people; the second would compel education to renounce its highest, noblest and sublimest claims in order to subordinate itself to . . . the service of the State.

That's to say, he's aghast mankind purports to have an interest in spreading learning to everyone, even though it perpetually renounces that claim by ejecting students to perform state services. Because of this, Nietzsche is frequently characterized as elitist, but factually he works more like an investigator and psychologist curiously unpacking and describing the scene of an ongoing crime. Namely, the widespread exclusion of the general population from the love of learning.
