# Rhetorical Illusions

To explain rhetorical illusions it helps to explain optical illusions first.

Take this cube for instance. Initially it looks like a cube, but after turning it slightly we can see it's complete structure. The cube even seemed to float previously. But why should illusions be strictly limited to optical fields? Can there be illusions of language? Can illusions of language be used to achieve social effects? Do illusions exist, just as wobbly, where language can be turned sideways to spoil the image of what we thought we had?

### 1. "We flew to the moon."
A TV broadcaster delivers this statement. You live in America and it's 1969. You know what this means, and you feel it in your heart. "We did it." Instantly you feel inclusion in the "we" of this sentence. This is because your mind automatically wants to feel inclusion in this positive statement.
 
But what about this?
### 2. "We tortured someone to death."

You're immediately stricken by disgust. You feel no inclusion here. The same "we" was spoken, but you experience distance this time, as you should. But why do listeners feel inclusion in (1) but not (2)? Why not both? Furthermore, it raises the question. Why would I feel included in the first one, but not the second?

Operationally speaking I am not an Apollo 11 astronaut. At no point did I come close to touching the ship, but I felt attraction to "we" in this case. Conversely, at no point did I participate in the torture and death of the victim in the second statement. This means inclusion is imaginary.

### Some thoughts from Heidegger
>Disregarding the question of the “ who,” which ones do we mean in speaking of “ we”? Ourselves, those at this moment objectively present, those here and now? But where would the enclosing circle be drawn? Or do we mean “the” human being as such? Yet “ the” human being “is” unhistorical only as being historical. Do we mean ourselves as this particular people? Even then, however, we are not the only ones but are a people with other peoples. And how is the essence of a people determined? It is clear at once: the way in which the questioned, namely the “we,” is initially established in the question contains already a decision about the “ who.” That means we cannot, untouched by the question of the “who,” postulate the “ we” and the “ us” as, so to speak, something objectively present to which only the determination of the “who” would be lacking. Even this question reflects the turning. It is a question that cannot be either asked or answered straightforwardly. Yet as long as the essence of philosophy is not grasped as meditation on the truth of beyng and as long as the necessity of the meditation on oneself, which thereby arises, has not become effective, the question as a question is already exposed to severe misgivings.
- Heidegger, "On the question: Who are we?", [Contributions to Philosophy (Of the Event)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Contributions_to_Philosophy/fnU-p4wyYYQC?hl=en&gbpv=0)

As Heidegger once recognized, "the enclosing circle cannot be drawn" around the "we'' in this case. In effect, "we" has been "turned" slightly (like with the cube that's no cube), revealing a "non we" where it's certainly not the case that we're a genuine part of either statement. I hypothesize that, just as humans recieved statement 1 as their reward in 1969, so too did humans recieve similar illusory statements when humans were persuaded to construct the [pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids). Indeed, it is for this reason Heidegger is so wildly disturbed by technology, because he knows collective inclusion in technological operation is impossible, which is bound to affect the evolution of consciousness. While it's difficult for people to question the value of technology today, it's worth mentioning [Cleopatra lived closer in time to the moon landing](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/so-cleopatra-lived-closer-in-time-to-the-first-lunar-landing-than-the-great-pyramids.html) than the great pyramids. Hence it's natural for philosophers to draw connecting lines from Plato to Nietzsche to Heidegger, as members of the philosophers concerned with the same problem set.

>To the last question we could answer: What men did when they unchained the earth from its sun is told in the last three and a half centuries of European history. What, then, has happened at the foundation of this history to that which is? When Nietzsche names the relationship between the sun and the earth he is not thinking merely of the Copernican revolution in the modern understanding of nature. The word "sun" at once recalls Plato's allegory ([[The Cave of Writing]]). According to the latter, the sun and the realm of its light are the sphere in which that which is appears according to its visible aspect, or according to its many countenances (Ideas). The sun forms and circumscribes the field of vision wherein that which is as such shows itself. Horizon" refers to the suprasensory world as the world that truly is.
- Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche", [The Question Concerning Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Question_Concerning_Technology)

Heidegger writes this in response to his interpretation of Nietzsche's madman, who says: "How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun?" as his rhetorical questions meant to elucidate how, exactly, humans killed God. What Heidegger imagines Nietzsche is disturbed by, is the same thing Plato is disturbed by, namely that the continuous activity of operating technology (that also includes reading and writing implements) will have a gradual effect on human consciousness, wiping away the horizon (the world as we know it).

Socrates \rightarrow Jesus

I theorize the sensation of inclusion in the death of the reasonable man (Socrates) was Plato's try at getting a crowd to see for themselves that being a reasonable person only gets you killed. See [[From Anglers to Fishers]] for a greater explaination of this particular historical transformation. We know Plato was influenced by the playwright Aristophanes, author of [The Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clouds). Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude Plato's "apology" was ironic, creating the structure of an ancient tragic comedy. All subsequent dialogues by Plato are written as mere flashbacks to what preceded the death of Socrates, like when a movie begins with the end. Through strategic use of irony, Plato gives us the sponge.
