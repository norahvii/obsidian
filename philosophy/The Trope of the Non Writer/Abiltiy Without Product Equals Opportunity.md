# Ability Without Product = Opportunity

When someone who's very wise exists who didn't write anything down, it crates an enigma. We're invited to imagine what they would have written if only they had done so. For thousands of years, we blindly obeyed our teachers and performed writing exercises. But what if this vacancy was intentional, some contrivance created through knowledge of The Cave of Writing?

When someone tells the story of a non writer, just as Strauss imagines, they protect themselves. Like a [puppeteer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppeteer) they can tell their persecuting audience the ideas are not their own. Doing this enables them to ask for the paper and ink required to investigate what the non writer said, or intended to say, thereby granting them access to the material economy. Two features combine to make this possible. First, [[Verified Writing Ability]] and second, [[No Physical Writings]]. 

I postulate that [Aristotle's Categories](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/) were created to encourage audiences to construct the Perfect Library or [The Library of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) however, this project failed in due time. Instead, the Socreates model for envying the death of the resonable one was reworked through the invention of the character of Jesus Christ as a technique to seduce the masses into becoming subordinate to the storytellers. Generations ago Karl Jaspers proposed the [[The Axial Age]] - which vaguely described a time frame where key historical figures went viral. What this really was, I gather, was an attempt to use rhetoric and arguement as a scheme to "filll in the blank" left by the vacancy.
