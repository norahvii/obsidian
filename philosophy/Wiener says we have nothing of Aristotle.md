# Wiener on Aristotle

[The Human Use Of Human Beings: Cybernetics And Society](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/88990.Norbert_Wiener)

>“May I remark that all we possess of Aristotle is what amounts to the school notebooks of his disciples, written in one of the most crabbed technical jargons in the history of the world, and totally unintelligible to any contemporary Greek who had not been through the discipline of the Lyceum? That this jargon has been sanctified by history, so that it has become itself an object of classical education, is not relevant; for this happened after Aristotle, not contemporaneously with him.”
