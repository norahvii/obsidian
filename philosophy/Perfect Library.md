# Perfect Library

"Perfect library" is the idea a thinker, such as Aristotle, formed all of their ideas through perfect mentors and perfect books. It's the idea someone such as Leibniz could have only been Leibniz if he had the perfect library, otherwise he would have become someone else. 

> Leibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Leipzig, and the boy later inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven.

Could Leibniz have been Leibniz if he was raised by wolves? No, and he would not have been smarter than the average wolfchild, either. 

The existence of [feral children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child) is well documented: a human cannot become fully free and be expected to learn. Rather, all human beings are engaged in a perpetual state of interpersonal competition, formulating their ideas as a result of being pitted against each other. Because this particular theory of knowledge is negative, it supports [[Strauss]]' view the ancients had a similarly negative view of knowledge and wrote in a manneer which had to bare in mind rhetorical attack, rhetorical function, and exoteric defense. 

J.C.R. Licklider outlines some of his thoughts his short book [Libraries of the Future](https://books.google.com/books/about/Libraries_of_the_Future.html?id=NQAiAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description) but my memory tells me his description was ironic. Likewise, utopian projects like [Google's Free Library Project Collapsed](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-08-10-what-happened-to-google-s-effort-to-scan-millions-of-university-library-books), also casting doubt on the Perfect Library as a valid project, due to the existence of the [information economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy).
