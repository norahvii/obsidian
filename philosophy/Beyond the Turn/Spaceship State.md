# The Spaceship State

In the future, our libraries could become a new body in what I'll call the Spaceship State machine. This is because Earth is a limited structure and, potentially, because information is used to determine human activity and the material on which those signs are written is a machine (computers), it stands to reason those technological materials will envelop all the people on earth, encasing them totally in a "Spaceship State" machine.

Now, it's worth remembering the bodies humans have now currently was, also, crated by genetic instruction, and it too is encased, except by flesh...

1. A human is a body-system.
2. It's boundary is skin.
3. It competes with it's surrounding human body-systems.
4. That competition-field is a State.
5. That state is determined by word-signs (called "The Law").
6. Word-signs have moved from paper to machine.
7. Machines can become a space for body-systems to dwell.
8. In doing so, body-systems become the state-system: *spaceship states*.
9. It's boundary is metal.
10. It competes with it's surrounding spaceship states...

### What if this is this a universal constant?
If these develomental constraints are predictable, can we use them to understand why life exists? Seemingly, this way of thinking has led to a way to track the trend of the unfolding of human consciousness, so can we track this trend backwards to understand life itself? In theorizing about "spaceship states" the intention, also, is dual: done to at the same time get even closer towards understanding life and consciousness.
