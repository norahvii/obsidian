# Jesus could write, but didn't.

[Did Jesus Write Anything?](https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_192.cfm)

> John 8:3-9
> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger._ _7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone_ _at her.”_ _8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.

>Jerome and Augustine, writing about seventy years after Eusebius, state that Jesus did not leave anything in writing.
